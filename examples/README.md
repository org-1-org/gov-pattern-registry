# Examples

**Non-normative reference implementations.**

The patterns in this directory demonstrate how to apply governance patterns in practice. They are:

- **Not authoritative** - These are examples, not standards
- **Not validated** - Unlike patterns in `patterns/`, these may not pass all schema validations
- **For learning** - Use as templates and starting points for your own governance artifacts

## Directory Structure

```
examples/
├── autogov/        # Self-governance example (autogov governing itself)
└── canonizer/      # Document canonization governance example
```

## Usage

Copy and adapt these examples for your own projects. They demonstrate real-world usage of the governance patterns defined in `patterns/`.

## Contributing

Example contributions welcome! Include a README explaining the use case and any special considerations.
